## SOLID

### Single resposibility principle
A class should have only one job

### Open closed principle
Objects should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Liskov substitution principle
Objects of child clases should behave as objects from the parent class

### Interface segregation principle
Reduce the side effects and frequency of required changes by splitting the code into multiple/independent parts.
Is better to have multiple interfaces that do something that on general interface

### Dependency Inversion Principle
High level modules should not depend on low level models. They should depend on abstractions
