## Work Relationships (STAR)
Write about the managers and coworkers who’ve impacted you the most. Consider also the most difficult work relationships you’ve encountered.

*Situation*
I was the only full-time employee on a team of contractors from Ukraine, which created a challenging work environment. They had personal and professional issues, and their country's situation made it difficult for them to focus on work.

*Task*
My task was to onboard with the team, learn from them, and deliver tasks efficiently despite the communication barriers and time zone differences.

*Action*
I decided to take the initiative and solve problems on my own. I wrote documentation to help fill knowledge gaps, assisted peers with their tasks, and took on defect tasks that no one else wanted to do. This helped me build trust with my peers and gain a deeper understanding of the project's complexities.

*Result*
Through my efforts, I established a positive working relationship with my peers, despite the initial challenges. While communication issues still arise due to their situations and time zones, we've developed a strong foundation for collaboration and mutual support.

## Work Relationships (STAR)
Write about the managers and coworkers who’ve impacted you the most. Consider also the most difficult work relationships you’ve encountered.

## Team Roles(STAR)
Write about what roles you’ve played on recent teams you’ve been a part of. How did you end up playing those roles? What has worked out well and what hasn’t been the best fit?

*Situation*
I was a Software Engineer II on a project where I was one of the initial team members. We built an MVP from scratch, but when the project progressed, my peers left, and I was the only one who knew the project's inner workings.

*Task*
I took on onboarding new team members and leading the project as the principal engineer. This involved justifying design decisions, communicating with management and stakeholders, and ensuring the project met its requirements.

*Action*
I worked diligently to transfer knowledge to the new team members, write and maintain documentation, and ensure the code was maintainable and efficient. I also had to adapt to new challenges and responsibilities as the project leader.

*Result*
As a result of my efforts, the project became self-sustaining, and I was able to successfully transfer knowledge to the team. I was promoted to Senior Engineer and moved to a new team with more challenging projects and higher impact. This was a significant achievement, as promotions are rare in my company, and it demonstrated my value as a high-impact and top-performing employee.

*What worked well:* "I was able to successfully lead the project, onboard new team members, and transfer knowledge to the team. The documentation I created and maintained helped ensure the project's sustainability."

*What didn't work well:* "Initially, it was challenging to answer all the questions and justify design decisions, but it was a necessary step in building trust with the team and stakeholders. However, it did require a significant amount of time and effort."
