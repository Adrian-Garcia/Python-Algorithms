## Career Transitions (STAR)
[CheatSheet](#cheatsheet)

Think about the career transitions you’ve made so far. Write about recent ones: what motivated them, what you felt like went well, and what could have gone better.

*Situation*
I recently made a career transition from Software Engineer II to Senior Engineer, which was a significant milestone in my career. In this company, promotions are rare and highly competitive, since they depend heavily on budgent and very few per year are granted.

*Task*
My tasks involved leading a project from scratch as the lead programmer, and later, taking on a new role in a team with a more challenging project that has a high impact on the company's main product.

*Action*
I demonstrated my capabilities by:

1. Creating a project from scratch and successfully leading it as the lead programmer, despite being a SWE II at the time and having to make critical decisions.

2. Successfully delivering the previous project and being asked to move to a new team with a more challenging project. I took on the role of maintaining the project, paying off technical debt, and enhancing it with new features.

I worked diligently to manage and maintain both projects, often taking on long hours of reading code, documentation, attending meetings, and coding. I made no decisions that could negatively affect the success of the project, and I'm proud of my achievements.

*Result*
As a result of my efforts, I successfully transitioned into a Senior Engineer role, which is a rare achievement in my company. I've demonstrated my ability to take on challenging projects and lead teams to success, which has given me a sense of pride and accomplishment.

*What could have gone better:* One thing that could have been improved was the amount of time it took to receive the promotion. However, I understand that promotions are competitive and dependent on budget, and I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had.

*What you learned:* Through this experience, I've learned the importance of perseverance and hard work in achieving my goals. I've also learned to appreciate the value of taking on new challenges and stepping out of my comfort zone

## Growth at Facebook

Write about what working at Facebook would help you become in the coming years.

I see myself being leader of my own project

## Interesting Projects (STAR)
[CheatSheet](#cheatsheet)

Consider projects you’ve undertaken - especially the largest, most difficult, most successful, least successful, etc. Write descriptions of these.

*Situation*
I recently took on a project with significant technical debt, which is a result of multiple teams working on it before us. The project's architecture, code, structure, documentation, and tools are in disarray, making it a challenging and difficult project to work on.

*Task*
My task was to pay off the technical debt and make the project more maintainable. This involved identifying and fixing bugs, investigating weird behaviors, and understanding every detail of the platform.

*Action*
I took on the responsibility of solving bugs and investigating weird behaviors, which required me to learn every detail of the platform. I had to perform tasks that the team often didn't want to do, such as:

- Identifying redundancies and areas of opportunity
- Detecting dependencies that can be deleted
- Identifying unused code
- Understanding the project's architecture and structure
- By doing these tasks, I gained a deeper understanding of the project's inner workings and was able to identify areas for improvement.

*Result*
As a result of my efforts, I have a better understanding of the project's strengths and weaknesses, and I'm able to make informed decisions about what to add, what to delete, and how to improve the platform. I've also developed a unique perspective on the project, which allows me to identify opportunities for growth and improvement.

## Taking Initiative (STAR)
[CheatSheet](#cheatsheet)

Write about how you’ve taken the initiative on teams you’ve been a part of. Where have you gone beyond what was expected?

*Situation*
In a team on  my current company, we had to do some tasks that required converting large files to compressed files like zip, gzip, and rar. I needed to compress a large file to gzip, but the free software I downloaded wasn't able to do it for free.

*Task*
My task was to find a way to compress the file to gzip without paying for the software. I decided to take the initiative and use Python's library to create a script that could do the job.

*Action*
I took the initiative to:
- Research and create a script using Python's library to compress files to gzip
- Modify the script to automate the process of downloading, formatting, and reuploading files
- Share the script with my peers, who were interested in learning how to compress files to gzip
- Continuously improve the script by adding more functionalities, such as compression to zip and rar
- By taking the initiative, I was able to create a solution that not only saved the company money but also improved the team's efficiency and productivity.

*Result*
As a result of my initiative, the team was able to stop using the paid software and instead use my script to compress files to gzip. The script was so successful that other teams forked it and added more functionalities, making it a company-wide solution. The payed software is no longer used in most teams, and I was able to achieve this with minimal effort and cost.

## Work Relationships (STAR)
[CheatSheet](#cheatsheet)

Write about the managers and coworkers who’ve impacted you the most. Consider also the most difficult work relationships you’ve encountered.

*Situation*
I was the only full-time employee on a team of contractors from Ukraine, which created a challenging work environment. They had personal and professional issues, and their country's situation made it difficult for them to focus on work.

*Task*
My task was to onboard with the team, learn from them, and deliver tasks efficiently despite the communication barriers and time zone differences.

*Action*
I decided to take the initiative and solve problems on my own. I wrote documentation to help fill knowledge gaps, assisted peers with their tasks, and took on defect tasks that no one else wanted to do. This helped me build trust with my peers and gain a deeper understanding of the project's complexities.

*Result*
Through my efforts, I established a positive working relationship with my peers, despite the initial challenges. While communication issues still arise due to their situations and time zones, we've developed a strong foundation for collaboration and mutual support.

## Team Roles (STAR)
[CheatSheet](#cheatsheet)

Write about what roles you’ve played on recent teams you’ve been a part of. How did you end up playing those roles? What has worked out well and what hasn’t been the best fit?

*Situation*
I was a Software Engineer II on a project where I was one of the initial team members. We built an MVP from scratch, but when the project progressed, my peers left, and I was the only one who knew the project's inner workings.

*Task*
I took on onboarding new team members and leading the project as the principal engineer. This involved justifying design decisions, communicating with management and stakeholders, and ensuring the project met its requirements.

*Action*
I worked diligently to transfer knowledge to the new team members, write and maintain documentation, and ensure the code was maintainable and efficient. I also had to adapt to new challenges and responsibilities as the project leader.

*Result*
As a result of my efforts, the project became self-sustaining, and I was able to successfully transfer knowledge to the team. I was promoted to Senior Engineer and moved to a new team with more challenging projects and higher impact. This was a significant achievement, as promotions are rare in my company, and it demonstrated my value as a high-impact and top-performing employee.

*What worked well:* "I was able to successfully lead the project, onboard new team members, and transfer knowledge to the team. The documentation I created and maintained helped ensure the project's sustainability."

*What didn't work well:* "Initially, it was challenging to answer all the questions and justify design decisions, but it was a necessary step in building trust with the team and stakeholders. However, it did require a significant amount of time and effort."
